Now I am going to describe the recipe of Chicken Khosha. This is very popular
dish in West Bengal.People used to rave this dish. I love this dish a lot.
This recipe contains gravy or soup. But both are made up of same recipe.
In this recipe , the chicken should be well boiled otherwise,it will be
hard and it will be difficult to eat.We should cook with different masala like 
garam masala and other masala.We can give the masala according to our diet.
As we should eat according to our capabities.This recipe I have learnt from my mother and she cooks very well.  At last if we mix coriander, it adds additional taste to this dish and smell becomes very sweet.
